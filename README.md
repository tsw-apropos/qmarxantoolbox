Marxan Processing tools for QGIS

[Marxan](https://marxansolutions.org/) is one of the leading conservation tools in the world. Marxan is designed as a decision support tool which asks the question, "How can I meet these targets efficiently?". Marxan uses spatial data in a non-spatial environment to test many different solutions to find near-optimal solutions to the before stated question. The QMarxan Toolbox for QGIS 3 and above provides a series of tools to generate convert spatial data into a format that Marxan can understand and use. The QMarxan Toolbox also provides tools to assist in the calibration of your Marxan analysis.
